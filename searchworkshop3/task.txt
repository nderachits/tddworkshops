As a developer I want a component that can index big documents and provide searching by a query string so I can use it as a search engine for files, documents or web pages

Input: a string or file, string is simpler
Output: a component that can return index of word in scanned text without rescanning.
Output 2: returns sentence with the word.
Output 3: returns similar word or sentence when there is no precise match, but words differs by 1 letter.

Test data: source code of Rails in a single file 11.8mb, will be provided.
Test word example "ISINDEX" case-sensitive, appears in the end of the file, test repeats 200times

words consists from letters, numbers and underscore _
case-sensitive is simpler, case-insensitive if there more time
commas, stops, columns are separators
